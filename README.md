# Constructor Word Guess Game

## Constructor node command line word guessing game was built using node.js and inquirer primarily utilizing constructor functions. Very similar to hangman, a user is prompted to guess from one of twelve gods or goddesses from Greek mythology letter by letter. 

# Prerequisites

    * Terminal or Gitbash
    * Node.js & NPM (Node Plugin Manager)
    * Clone down repo

##### Enter `npm install` in either Terminal or Gitbash to install neccessary packages to run this application.

# How to Play

### To begin the game, navigate to the repo in either Terminal or Gitbash and enter `node index.js` which will initiate the game.
### The rules are simple, guess letter by letter to complete the randomly chosen God or Goddess. Be sure to hit enter after your guessed letter. 
###### The game will only recognize one character at at time so be sure to not enter a phrase!

### After you lose or you run out of characters to guess you will be prompted to play again. If you choose no the game will exit. To begin again simply enter `node index.js`.
